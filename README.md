Alpha-Sec

As of 16 Nov 2021, this is a script to run initial recon on a target.  Right now it uses premade scripts from Linux distros.  As this application evolves,
I will add more technical security testing measures.

I am automating parts of security testing so I can concentrate on the actual issues.

Trying to expand this script to automate more than just initial steps in testing a network.

I am learning how to program Python and writing shortcuts to use material as I go to college.
